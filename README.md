# UMaine System Professor Ratings

A Chrome extension that displays the professors rating from RateMyProfessors.com on the [USM](https://usm.maine.edu/courses) and [UMaine](https://online.umaine.edu/how-to-search-for-courses/) course search page. For the University of Southern Maine if you go to the professor's individual page on usm.maine.edu it will display the rating as well.
